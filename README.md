# TwitterToRedditBot

## Purpose

This is a small, Python-based bot for posting a Twitter user's tweets on Reddit. It's nice to have for breaking news/updates from a Twitter user relevant to your subreddit (a developer, a journalist, a player, a politician, etc...)

## Configuration

Configure with Twitter API keys, Reddit API keys, and the account credentials. Don't forget to specify the Twitter user and subreddit to post to!

## Usage

`python main.py`

It's that simple.
